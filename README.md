# Openweather Web App

This project is a web application designed to consume and visualize the results of our complete pipeline. It was created as part of an end-of-module project. This portion of the project was managed collaboratively by **Hamza** and **Jihad**.

## Project Overview :

The application consists of the following key parts:
- **Data Pipeline :** Processes and prepares data for visualization.
- **Frontend :** A Vue.js-based interface for displaying charts and insights.
